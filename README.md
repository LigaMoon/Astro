### Design


- #### Color scheme
    - Since the content of this website is space-related (astronomy and astrology), 
    I aimed to create a 'night-sky' color theme. To achieve this I opted to use a dark background with light text/graphics 
    and even darker accent color while maintaining high enough contrast for readability. 
    I chose to keep the color scheme minimal to create a classy, timeless, and almost mysterious look and create a sense of wonder in the user. 
    The main colors used are Prussian Blue (#1F293B), Light Goldenrod Yellow (#FFFFD6) and as an accent color, 
    I used Rich Black FOGRA 29 (#131A27). To pick the exact shades of the colors I used  [coolors](https://coolors.co/) 
    color palette generator.

        <img src="./assets/images/readme/colorscheme.png" height="40px" />

- #### Typography
    - The main font used across all pages is a serif type of font 'Lora' with serif as a fallback font. 
    This font is meant to increase the quality and speed of readability to counteract possible difficulties of reading 
    light text on a dark background.

        <img src="./assets/images/readme/lora.png" height="20px" />

    - The secondary font used is a decorative font 'Elina'. This font is used as a style choice in headings as 
    well as an accent throughout pages. This font is cursive and very elegant and is meant to add to the classy look of the page.

        <img src="./assets/images/readme/elina.png" height="20px" />

- #### Imagery
    - The main purpose of the graphics used is to be informative as they accurately illustrate the zodiac sign or the constellation in 2D.
    The secondary purpose of the minority of graphics used is decorative, such as the star on the home page. However, 
    all the graphics were custom designed and drawn either by me or by a graphic designer 
    Claire Schorman and were meant to elevate the design of the page.
    - No pictures were used in making of this website.

- #### Wireframes
    - Wireframes were created using Adobe Xd

## Features

### Existing Features

#### Common Features Across All Pages
- [x] **Header** - allows user to easily navigate across all pages
    - The header itself is positioned to always be visible (positioned absolutely using Bootstrap 'sticky-top' class) at the top of the screen (mobile, tablet, and desktop) which allows visitors to find it quickly.
    - The brand logo as well as brand word is positioned on the left and is visible on all pages, it serves as a home page link so the user can find her/his way back if needed.
    - Navigation is included in the header to let the user intuitively locate it.
    - Navigation links become lighter and have a star icon become visible (only in desktop) when hovered over. This lets the visitor know that it is clickable.
    - The navigation link, matching the page that the user is visiting, stays 'active'(which matches the hover effect from the previous point) to let the user quickly establish which page she/he is visiting.
    - Navigation links collapse in a personalized hamburger menu when viewed in mobile sizes.
    - Colors have been chosen with optimum contrast in mind to be pleasant to the eye.
- [x] **Headings**
    - All main heading styles have been applied using JavaScript ([main.js](https://github.com/liigalized/astro/blob/master/assets/scripts/main.js)) to avoid cluttering HTML and provide consistency throughout all pages.
- [x] **Links/buttons**
    - All links and buttons have been styled uniformly to let the user know without hovering over that those are clickable.
    - When the user hovers over, the link/button text increase in brightness.
    - Most of the links/buttons (with two purposeful exceptions), have the page brand star icon become visible on the left side when hovered over.
    - The star graphic on all links is generated in JavaScript ([main.js](https://github.com/liigalized/astro/blob/master/assets/scripts/main.js)) to avoid cluttering HTML file and provide consistency throughout all pages.
- [x] **Responsiveness**
    - All Pages are responsive and provide the same functionality regardless of the viewport size.
- [x] **Accessibility**
    - There are no flashing images or sounds to hinder the user experience.
    - All button graphics used, have been added as a background to prevent screen readers from having to read out each image description.
- [x] **Graphic Buttons**
    - When a button, displaying a constellation or zodiac sign, is clicked, it changes the heading in the main container and the icon related to the main container (if any).
    - This functionality is done by using JavaScript ([main.js](https://github.com/liigalized/astro/blob/master/assets/scripts/main.js))
    - Graphic buttons are generated using JavaScript ([main.js](https://github.com/liigalized/astro/blob/master/assets/scripts/main.js))

## Credits

### Code :floppy_disk:
- Most of the code was written by the author - Liga Baikova in jQuery.
- The code in the calculator.js file lines 90 - 101 was provided to me by my mentor Maranatha Ilesanmi. The code refreshes the Calculator page when navigated to and prevent previous entries from saving (caching).
- The 3D models were coded using the Three.js library. Even though I used the docs, examples, and tutorials supplied on their website, there isn't anything quite like my model so even though the 'HOW' was taken from the website, the 'WHAT' was produced by me.
- 3D models were coded in JavaScript rather than jQuery to be consistent with Three.js docs and allow for easier debugging.
- jQuery library and docs were used in most JavaScript files.
- Bootstrap was used in layout coding as well as the navigation, collapsable hamburger menu and the footer.
